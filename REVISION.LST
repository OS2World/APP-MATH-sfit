v1.1.0 
   - Fixed problem which prevented further fits after an error. It
     is thus no longer necessary to restart the program after a DLL error.
   - Fixed include/exclude region which sometimes flagged the wrong points.
   - Fixed cursor which was not tracking the data.
v1.09
   - Save the paths for loading DLLs, interpreter files and the state files
     to facilitate subsequent load from the same directory.
